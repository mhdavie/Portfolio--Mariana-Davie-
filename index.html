            <p>I am from Brazil and my first Language is Portuguese.
                I am from Sao Paolo state and was born and raised in a city located in Sao Paulo named Sao Jose do Rio Preto. </p>                
             <p>Back in my home country I was a Special Ed. Teacher and never thought about persuing a tech carrer.             
                Last year events made me rethink about my interests and dreams.</p> 
                After a long time waiting and researching I am finally ready to take my first step towards my goal to become a Web Developer.</p></section>
